          <h2>Reckless Love</h2>
          <p>
            <i>(verse 1)</i><br />Before I spoke a word, You were singing over me
You have been so, so good to me <br />
            Before I took a breath, You breathed Your life in me
You have been so, so kind to me <br />
            
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>(chorus)</i><br />
           Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
Oh, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm found, leaves the ninety-nine <br />
            I couldn't earn it, and I don't deserve it, still, You give Yourself away
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God, yeah<br />
            
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>(verse 2)</i><br />
            When I was Your foe, still Your love fought for me
You have been so, so good to me<br />
            When I felt no worth, You paid it all for me
But You have been so, so kind to me<br />
          </p>
          <p><i>(repeat chorus)</i></p>

          <p>
            <i>(bridge)</i> <br />
            There's no shadow You won't light up
Mountain You won't climb up
Coming after me <br />
There's no wall You won't kick down
Lie You won't tear down
Coming after me <i>(repeat 4x)</i>
          </p>
          <p><i>(repeat chorus)</i></p>

          <h2>Way Maker</h2>

          <h2>Bigger Than I Thought</h2>
          <p>
            <i>(verse 1)</i><br />Speak to me When the silence steals my voice
            You understand me You understand me <br />
            Come to me In the valley of unknowns You understand me You
            understand me <br />
            You understand me, God You understand me
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>(chorus)</i><br />
            So I throw all my cares before You My doubts and fears don't scare
            You <br />
            You're bigger than I thought You were You're bigger than I thought
            <br />I stop all negotiations With the God of all creation You're
            bigger than I thought You were<br />
            You're bigger than I thought You were
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>(verse 2)</i><br />
            I believe But help my unbelief You understand me You understand
            me<br />
            Help me reach The faith that's underneath You understand me You
            understand me Yes, <br />You understand me, God You understand me,
            oh
          </p>
          <p><i>(repeat chorus)</i></p>

          <p>
            <i>(bridge)</i> <br />
            I will rest in the Father's hands <br />
            Leave the rest in the Father's hands <i>repeat 4x</i>
          </p>
          <p><i>(repeat chorus)</i></p>

          <h2>Tremble</h2>
          <p>
            Peace, bringing it all to peace The storm surrounding me Let it
            break at Your name
          </p>

          <h2>Do It Again</h2>
          <p>
            <i>(verse 1)</i><br />Walking around these walls
I thought by now they'd fall
But You have never failed me yet <br />
            Waiting for change to come
Knowing the battle's won
For You have never failed me yet <br />
            
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>(chorus)</i><br />
           Your promise still stands
Great is Your faithfulness, faithfulness <br />
            I'm still in Your hands
This is my confidence, You've never failed me yet<br />
            
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>(verse 2)</i><br />
            I know the night won't last
Your Word will come to pass
My heart will sing Your praise again<br />
            Jesus, You're still enough
Keep me within Your love
My heart will sing Your praise again<br />
          </p>
          <p><i>(repeat chorus)</i></p>

          <p>
            <i>(bridge)</i> <br />
            I've seen You move, come move the mountains
And I believe, I'll see You do it again <br />
You made a way, where there was no way
And I believe, I'll see You do it again <i>(repeat 3x)</i>
          </p>
          <p><i>(repeat chorus)</i></p>

          <h2>Another In The Fire </h2>
          <p>
            <i>(verse1)</i><br />
            There's a grace when the heart is under fire
Another way when the walls are closing in
And when I look at the space between<br />
            Where I used to be and this reckoning
I know I will never be alone 
        <i>(repeate verse1)</i><br />  </p>

          <p>
            <i>(chorus)</i><br />
            There was another in the fire
Standing next to me
There was another in the waters
Holding back the seas <br />
            And should I ever need reminding
Of how I've been set free
There is a cross that bears the burden
Where another died for me
There is another in the fire
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>(verse2)</i><br />
            All my debt left for dead beneath the waters
I'm no longer a slave to my sin anymore
And should I fall in the space between <br />
            What remains of me and this reckoning
Either way I won't bow to the things of this world
And I know I will never be alone <br /> 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <i>(chorus)</i><br />
            There is another in the fire
Standing next to me
There is another in the waters
Holding back the seas <br />
            And should I ever need reminding
What power set me free
There is a grave that holds no body
And now that power lives in me <br /> 
There is another in the fire, oh
There is another in the fire, whoa
There is another in the fire, whoa
There is another in the fire, oh
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>(bridge)</i> <br />And I can see the light in the darkness
As the darkness bows to Him
I can hear the roar in the heavens
As the space between wears thin<br />
            I can feel the ground shake beneath us
As the prison walls cave in
Nothing stands between us
Nothing stands between us
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <i>(verse 3)</i><br />There is no other name but the name that is Jesus
He who was and still is, and will be through it all
So come what may in the space between <br />
            All the things unseen and this reckoning
And I know I will never be alone
And I know I will never be alone <br />
            
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>(chorus)</i><br />
            There'll be another in the fire
Standing next to me
There'll be another in the waters
Holding back the seas <br />
            And should I ever need reminding
How good You've been to me
I'll count the joy come every battle
'Cause I know that's where You'll be <br /> 

          </p>
          <p>
            <i>(repeat bridge)</i> <br /> </p>
          
          
          
          

          <h2>Good Good Father</h2>
          <p>
            <i>(verse 1)</i><br />I've heard a thousand stories of what they think you're like
But I've heard the tender whispers of love in the dead of night
 <br />
           And you tell me that you're pleased
And that I'm never alone <br />
            
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>(chorus)</i><br />
            You're a good good father
It's who you are, it's who you are, it's who you are <br />
            
            And I'm loved by you
It's who I am, it's who I am, it's who I am<br />
            
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>(verse 2)</i><br />
            I've seen many searching for answers far and wide
But I know we're all searching<br />
            For answers only you provide
'Cause you know just what we need<br />Before we say a word
          </p>
          <p><i>(repeat chorus)</i></p>
           <p>
            <i>(bridge)</i> <br />
            You are perfect in all of your ways
You are perfect in all of your ways<br />
            You are perfect in all of your ways to us<i>(repeat 2x)</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>(verse 3)</i><br />Oh, it's love so undeniable
I, I can hardly speak
Peace so unexplainable
 <br />
           I, I can hardly think
As you call me deeper still
As you call me deeper still<br />
            As you call me deeper still
Into love, love, love <br />
            
          </p>
          <p><i>(repeat chorus x2)</i></p>
